   <h1>Our Story</h1>
   <p>Eta Pie is the brainchild of three long time friends who believe that only the limits of imagination and creativity should dictate how you create your pizzas, salads or bowls. Thus, our offerings range from the traditional to the whimsical and culinarily serious. </p><p>We encourage our valued customers to build their own masterpieces, matched perfectly to their individual preferences drawing from our palate of two pizza crusts, two bowl foundations, three blends of salad greens, five sauces, over thirty premium toppings, thirteen finishing options and six house-made salad dressings. We also invite choices from among more than twenty-five pre-curated pizza, salad and bowl options born of our chefs' inspirations.</p>

   <br><h1>Our Commitment</h1>
   <p>We are committed to using clean, sustainable ingredients and having everything we serve taste great. In keeping with this core philosophy, we insist upon humanely raised, antibiotic and hormone-free meat. </p>
   <p>Our quality seafood is always sourced in accordance with the recommendations of the <strong><span><a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/">Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch.</a></span></strong></p>
   <p>Much of our produce is certified organic and we are constantly mindful of fair trade practices and other aspects of how our suppliers operate. The bottom line is that if we wouldn't eat it ourselves or feed it to our children, you can be sure you will <strong>not</strong> find it at <strong>Eta Pie.</strong></p>

   <br><h1>To Our Customers </h1>
   <p>We are, first and foremost, consumers too. Therefore, we strive to provide the same level of service and responsiveness we want to receive in our own personal interactions with other businesses. Likewise, we create our menu offerings to exacting standards and we strive to meet those standards with every order. </p>
   
   <p>When we fall short (and, since nobody is perfect) we will do everything we can to make things <strong>more than right</strong> - we will solve the problem and offer something extra in recognition of the inconvenience. </p>
   <p>With a customer first mindset, we are always looking to improve our quality and service. This means we welcome your suggestions, comments and criticisms. </p>
   <p>*We encourage you to tell us when we succeed and when we miss the mark, so your experience is consistently the best we can provide.Your input will always be taken seriously because we recognize that serving you is the foundation upon which we succeed or fail.</p>

    <br><h1>Our Pledge</h1>
    <p>We believe that businesses have an obligation to invest in and engage with their local communities beyond simply serving customers. Therefore, we take our role as a member of the Ithaca and Tompkins County communities as seriously as we take our commitment to our food and unmatched customer service.</p>
    <p>In furtherance of good corporate citizenship, we actively support community activities; we provide no-cost food to those who are food insecure; we are a second chance employer for those who, for any of a variety of reasons, face challenges in securing employment opportunities; and we cater, at no cost, birthday parties for children whose families would not otherwise be able to provide this experience for them.</p>
    <p>We are always open to suggestions for additional ways in which we can support our community and share with our neighbors.</p>
